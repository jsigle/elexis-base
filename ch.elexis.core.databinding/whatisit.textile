h1. Elexis Databinding

In fact, this is JFace Databinding, adapted to IPersistentObjects.

JFace Databinding is an implementation of the observer-pattern on the Eclipse framwork. You can combine any two Objects, so they keep in-sync.
Consider a Text-Field an a property of a datastore object. If we make an IObservable from each, we can link them, so the Text Field updates whenever the 
model changes and vice versa.

h2. How use it?

You can create an IObservable from any field of any IPersistentObject simply by creating a new ch.elexis.core.databinding.PersistentObjectObservableValue. 
You can create IObservables from JFace UI widgets with their respective factories, and then you can bind them together.

h2. Dependencies

ch.elexis.core.databinding has only a dependency to org.eclipse.core.databinding, com.ibm.icu and to ch.elexis.core. Of course, if you want to combine IPersistentObjects to JFace Widgets, you'll need JFace as well.
