h1=. Prepare and configure a working environment in eclipse for Elexis

h2. Prerequisites and Sources

# Download and install Mercurial binaries
# Download Eclipse _Juno_ and unpack it into an appropriate directory
# on first launch create a directory for the workspace, e.g. 'elexis-classic-2.1.x'
# Within Eclipse, find Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Workspace and set the text file encoding to 'UTF-8'
# Go to help-&gt;eclipse Marketplace and install &quot;MercurialEclipse&quot; from there. Restart Eclipse after that
# Right-click in the package explorer and select &quot;import&quot;, then &quot;Mercurial-&gt;clone existing repository&quot;
# clone elexis-base and update to branch 2.1.7. I recommend to import only the following projects for now: ch.elexis, ch.elexis.core, ch.elexis.developer.resources, ch.elexis.h2.connector, ch.rgw.utility, LogBackend, org.ekkescorner.logging.osgi
# Select Project-&gt;clean-&gt;clean all projects from the eclipse menu
# Everything should be okay, except the ekkescorner plugin.
# Again, right-click in the package explorer and clone the repository &quot;elexis-addons&quot;
# import only ch.ngiger.elexis.opensource from that repository
# Open ch.ngiger.elexis.opensource and double-click desktop.dev.target. The file will open, and a lengthy operation&quot;Resolving Target Definition&quot; will begin (watch the right-hand lower corner of your eclipse window for progress informations)
# Click &quot;set as target platform&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the desktop.dev.target window. Again, this will take some time, and, if your firewall is active, you must allow eclipse.app to accept incoming connections.

Now, The Workspace should compile without errors

h2. Creating a minimal run configuration

# Go to 'Run->Run Configurations'. Create a new "Eclipse Application".
# Select "Run a Product" and select ch.elexis.ElexisProduct from the drop-down-list
# Go to the page 'Plug-ins' and chose "Launch with: plug-ins selected below only"
# click 'deselect all', then select "workspace" and hit "Add required plugins"
# now, select &quot;Run&quot; and your first home-made Elexis should start.

h2. extending the workspace

After successful launch, you can import more Plugins as needed from the repositories by using "import->mercurial->"Projects from local mercurial Repository".
